# research

We have organized this repo in two categories initially:
* User Research: Research conducted relevant to our initial site of deployment in Oakland, CA and the SF Bay Area generally
* Other Networks: Research on other community wireless / mesh networks around the world

Please contribute any and all relevant bits of research!
